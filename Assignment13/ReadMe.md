# What is the goal of your website? (Think in terms of your user -- why might they visit your site?) Why is responsive web design important?

The goal of my website is to create a base for a brand that has yet to become. I want users to visit my website because they enjoy the product, art, and skate culture that we bring with our own style. I think responsive design is important because it keeps the user engaged and can add creativity and uniqueness to your site. The longer you can engage the user the more they explore your site.
