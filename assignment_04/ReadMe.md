# How Browsers Function

Browsers function by retrieving information from other areas in the web, and displaying that information on whichever device you are searching with. In order to display what you are viewing on the screen, browsers use a software called a rendering engine that processes the graphics and text. I currently use safari for my browser because it was the default browser I was given.
