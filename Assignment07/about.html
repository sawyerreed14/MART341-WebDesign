        About us
      </h2>
  <p>
    Orca skate company provides our customers with our <strong>signature</strong> skate decks, and <strong>stylish</strong> streetwear
    while providing <strong>comfort</strong>, and <strong>durability</strong>. As a brand, we hate sea world. <blockquote>All my homies hate sea world.</blockquote> And for that,
    we plan on donating a portion of our profits towards Saving The Southern Resident Killer Whales Program. We do not have
    any money, or any clothing made for that matter, but we have an idea and a plan to make it happen! Coming soon....
