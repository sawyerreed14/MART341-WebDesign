# How did your user testing sessions go? What changes (if any) did you make to your website based on the user feedback you received? Optional: What challenges did you face this week, and how did you overcome them?

Sadly due to the known situation I wasn't able to get anyone to test my website. I am currently facing challenges with my design of my site and cant get some components to line up properly, which is why I am reaching out to you via a meeting tomorrow.
